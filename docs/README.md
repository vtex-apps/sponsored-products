VTEX Sponsored Products is responsible for implementing the necessary frontend apps to properly render the sponsored products.

:warning: Keep in mind that this app alone **will not** request the sponsored products; it will only add the "Sponsored" badge and add the Analytics wrapper.

## Configuration

### Step 1: Adding the Sponsored Products app to your theme's dependency

In your theme's `manifest.json`, add the Sponsored Products app as a dependency:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.sponsored-products": "0.x"
  }
```

Now, you are able to use all the blocks exported by the `sponsored-products` app. Check out the full list below:

#### `sponsored-products` blocks

| Block name        | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sponsored-badge` | Renders the "Sponsored" badge in your Product Summary. You can customize its CSS however fits best your store. |
| `ads-analytics`   | Necessary for observing impression and click metrics to assess the performance of the campaigns                |

### Step 2: Using the Sponsored Products blocks

#### The sponsored badge

This is fairly straightforward: simply call it as a child block on you Product Summary shelf. For example:

```diff
"product-summary.shelf": {
    "children": [
        "stack-layout#prodsum",
        "product-summary-space",
+       "sponsored-badge",
        "product-summary-name",
        "flex-layout.col#productRating",
        "product-summary-space",
        "product-list-price#summary",
        "flex-layout.row#selling-price-savings",
        "product-installments#summary",
        "add-to-cart-button"
    ]
},
```

They can also be added anywhere where a product is in context. For instance, in a product carrousel.

#### The Ads Analytics wrapper

For this one, you'll need to use the Ads Analytics directly as children of your Gallery block. For instance:

```diff
"gallery": {
    "props": {
        "layouts": [
            {
                "name": "grid",
                "component": "GridSummary",
                "itemsPerRow": {
                    "(min-width:1300px)": 4,
                    "desktop": 3,
                    "tablet": 3,
                    "phone": 2
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "list",
                "component": "ListSummary",
                "itemsPerRow": 1
            }
        ],
+       "ListSummary": "ads-analytics#listLayout",
+       "GridSummary": "ads-analytics"
    }
},

+ "ads-analytics": {
+   "props": {
+       "ProductSummary": "product-summary.shelf"
+   }
+ },

+ "ads-analytics#listLayout": {
+   "props": {
+   "ProductSummary": "product-summary.shelf#listLayout"
+   }
+ },

```

## Blocks

### `sponsored-badge`

### `ads-analytics`

| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `ProductSummary` | `string` | The component used for the Product Summary. | `undefined`   |

## Customization

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).
